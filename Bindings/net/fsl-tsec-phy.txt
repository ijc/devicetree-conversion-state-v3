* MDIO IO device

Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/fsl,gianfar-mdio.yaml

* TBI Internal MDIO bus

Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/fsl,gianfar-mdio.yaml

* Gianfar-compatible ethernet nodes

Properties:

  - device_type : Should be "network"
  - model : Model of the device.  Can be "TSEC", "eTSEC", or "FEC"
  - compatible : Should be "gianfar"
  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
  - interrupts : For FEC devices, the first interrupt is the device's
    interrupt.  For TSEC and eTSEC devices, the first interrupt is
    transmit, the second is receive, and the third is error.
  - phy-handle : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
  - fixed-link : See fixed-link.txt in the same directory.
  - phy-connection-type : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
    This property is only really needed if the connection is of type
    "rgmii-id", as all other connection types are detected by hardware.
  - fsl,magic-packet : If present, indicates that the hardware supports
    waking up via magic packet.
  - fsl,wake-on-filer : If present, indicates that the hardware supports
    waking up by Filer General Purpose Interrupt (FGPI) asserted on the
    Rx int line.  This is an advanced power management capability allowing
    certain packet types (user) defined by filer rules to wake up the system.
  - bd-stash : If present, indicates that the hardware supports stashing
    buffer descriptors in the L2.
  - rx-stash-len : Denotes the number of bytes of a received buffer to stash
    in the L2.
  - rx-stash-idx : Denotes the index of the first byte from the received
    buffer to stash in the L2.

Example:
	ethernet@24000 {
		device_type = "network";
		model = "TSEC";
		compatible = "gianfar";
		reg = <0x24000 0x1000>;
		local-mac-address = [ 00 E0 0C 00 73 00 ];
		interrupts = <29 2 30 2 34 2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mpic>;
		phy-handle = <&phy0>
	};
